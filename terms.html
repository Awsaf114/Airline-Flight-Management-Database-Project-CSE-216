Your booking is subject to the applicable fare conditions and the availability of seats in that fare group. You need to pay online with a credit card.<br /><br />You are only able to make amendments or cancellations on the booking you are making prior to confirming your reservation online. Any modifications after this must be made via your local Buet Airlines office or Contact Centre. All reservations, including modifications and cancellations are subject to the Terms and Conditions, Customer Care Policy, General Conditions of Carriage and any applicable fees and charges (including but not limited to fare rules of the ticket and Guest Service Fee).</p>

<p>Information to passengers departing from an airport in the European Union regarding our policies and their rights in the event of denied boarding, flight delay or flight cancellation</p>
<p>This notice contains important information about your rights established by European Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004 (&lsquo;the Regulation&rsquo;) and applies to you if:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a confirmed reservation on a flight departing from an airport in the European Union which is operated by Buet Airlines Airways, purchased at a fare available directly or indirectly to the general public; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>(except in the case where your flight has been cancelled) you have presented yourself for check-in before the Check-In Deadline as specified by us in our General Conditions of Carriage&nbsp; or related regulations; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>you have been denied boarding involuntarily and the reason for such denial has not been a matter set out in our General Conditions of Carriage or related regulations; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>or your flight is delayed by more than four hours beyond its scheduled departure time (for flights departing from Larnaca or Athens, this qualifying delay needs to be more than three hours beyond its scheduled departure time); or</li>

</ul>
<h4 class="paragraphheaderh4">DENIED BOARDING</h4>
<p>In the event that a seat is not available for a passenger with a confirmed reservation, we will seek volunteers to surrender their seats in exchange for benefits that we and the volunteer may agree upon before involuntarily denying boarding to other passengers. If there are insufficient volunteers and we deny you boarding involuntarily, you are entitled to the rights set out below.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="paragraphheaderh4">FLIGHT DELAY</h4>
<p>If we reasonably expect your flight to be delayed for four hours or more beyond its scheduled time of departure (but three hours in the case of flights departing from Larnaca or Athens), you are entitled to the rights set out below.&nbsp;</p>

<li>you are informed of the cancellation less than seven days before the scheduled time of departure and are offered re-routing, allowing you to depart no more than one hour before the scheduled time of departure and to reach your final destination less than two hours after the scheduled time of arrival; or&nbsp;</li>
<li>(in respect of any &lsquo;Right to Compensation&rsquo;) we can prove that the cancellation is caused by extraordinary circumstances which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken by Buet Airlines Airways, including but not limited to political instability, safety and security reasons, weather disruption, labour disputes or failure or delay of air traffic control facilities.</li>
</ul>
<h5>1. RIGHT TO COMPENSATION</h5>

<ul>
<li>by three hours, in respect of all flights of &nbsp;3,500km or less; or&nbsp;</li>

<p>(b) re-routing, under comparable transport conditions, to your final destination at the earliest opportunity; or</p>
<p>(c) re-routing, under comparable transport conditions, to your final destination at a later date at your convenience, subject to availability of seats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your flight is delayed by at least five hours and you elect not to travel, you are entitled to receive reimbursement as set out in point (a) above.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>3. RIGHT TO CARE</h5>
<p>If you are involuntarily denied boarding or if your flight is cancelled or delayed by more than 4 hours, (in the case of flights departing from Larnaca or Athens, the qualifying delay is 3 hours or more) we will offer you, free of charge:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
